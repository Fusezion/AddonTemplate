# AddonTemplate (Maven)
My goal with this template is to add any util methods I find useful for addon making or management and to keep it up to date with all the latest skript releases.
I will always support the latest and for those who prefer an older version I will include a branch for the last release of the build. (ex: 2.6 will be 2.6.4, 2.7 will be 2.7.x)

As time goes on I hope my skill with Java will grow and I can continue to keep this template as a viable option to anyone actively creating addons or looking to create their first addon without the hassle of building it all from scratch.
